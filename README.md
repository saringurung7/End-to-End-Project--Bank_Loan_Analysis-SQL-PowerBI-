## Problem Statement

The dashboard provided stakeholders with actionable insights into the bank's loan portfolio by tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and analyzing loan quality, repayment trends, and borrower demographics. It helped identify monthly trends in loan demand, funding, and repayment consistency, allowing for improved cash flow and risk management. By differentiating between "Good" and "Bad" loans, stakeholders could assess overall loan quality and make informed decisions to enhance portfolio health. Additionally, regional and demographic breakdowns, such as loan distribution by state, loan purpose, and borrower profiles, enabled targeted strategies for high-potential regions and borrower segments. 


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load Data into SQL: The initial step involved importing the CSV dataset into SQL, preparing it for structured analysis and enabling efficient data handling.
- Step 2 : Create Database: A dedicated database was created to store loan data, ensuring organized storage for streamlined querying and analysis.
- Step 3 : SQL Analysis: Using SQL, specific queries were designed as per the problem statement to extract required KPIs and insights. The output was stored and documented, establishing a clear basis for loan metrics and trends.
- Step 4 : Connect SQL to Power BI: The final step was to connect Power BI to the SQL database, allowing the visual dashboard to be directly compared with SQL output for accuracy. This integration enabled real-time data visualization, showcasing insights through interactive graphs and charts in Power BI.
